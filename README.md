## DynaBench - Testing and Evading Dynamic Analysis in Android Apps

### About this project

DynaBench is the result of my bachelor thesis for the [Bachelor of Science Technology, Liberal Arts and Sciences (better known as ATLAS)](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/bachelor/programmes/university-college-twente/) at the University of Twente. Read the abstract (or full paper) below.

### Abstract of the paper

<p> 
Today’s smart phones are a treasure trove of
private information. Access to this data is often
abused by apps. In response, the research
community has proposed tools to analyse apps
for privacy leaks. To evaluate these tools microbenchmarks
exist for static analysis tools but
not for dynamic analysis tools. These existing
micro-benchmarks are insufficient to test
dynamic analysis since dynamic analysis has
unique problems. In particular, apps can recognise
analysis is happening and stop malicious
behaviour. Techniques to apps use to do this
recognition we call ‘evasion techniques’.
We present DynaBench, an open source
micro-benchmark for dynamic analysis tools.
DynaBench functions by testing if the tool is robust
against these evasion techniques. This is
done by actively trying to evade analysis using
different techniques. We tested DynaBench
against the VirusTotal platform and found that
seven out of thirteen techniques were succesful
in evading dynamic analysis. We conclude that
is remains relatively easy to evade dynamic
analysis.
